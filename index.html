        <p class="message">Hi...I miss you already. You were with me just 20 minutes ago, but I miss you so much. I just want to say that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. Your love makes me feel alive. You are my favorite person, and I mean it. Just thinking about you makes me happy.
            I love everything about you...your funny personality, your beautiful heart, your wonderful smile, your silken hair , your sexy body , your magical eyes , your soft lips , your dirty mind hehe ... everything. I love you whether you're happy or sad, relaxing or angry, strong or vulnerable... You are just so special to me.           
            Thank you for your love, even when I don't deserve it. Thank you for your trust, your care, and everything you do. I really appreciate and respect you so much. I can't wait for the day I can cuddle you in my arms and kiss you. It will be like a dream come true... <br>
